2008-11-07  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@googlemail.com>

	* server/CommMetaClient.cpp: Remove some compile time debug.

2008-11-06  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@googlemail.com>

	  that cyphesis would never talk to the metaserver if the name
	  resolution at startup failed.

	* server/server.cpp: Modify the way MetaClient is set up as it

	  property access functions that should never be used to modify a
	  property const. Remove requirePropertyClass() as it pretty much
	  can't be const.

	* rulesets/Entity.cpp, rulesets/Entity.h: Make overriden
	  getProperty() const as it is in the base class. Add new
	  property access functions for code that needs to modify the
	  properties which ensures class properties never get modified

	  rulesets/TerrainModProperty.cpp, server/CorePropertyManager.cpp:

	  common/Makefile.am: Remove obsolete DynamicProperty from the
	  build.

2008-09-27  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@googlemail.com>

	* server/EntityFactory.cpp: Now that the property manager always
	  creates something, there is no longer any need to deal with it
	  returning 0.

2008-09-27  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@googlemail.com>

	* server/CorePropertyManager.cpp, server/CorePropertyManager.h:
	  Re-work the property manager to always create a property,
	  using closest match specialisations of the template where
	  possible. Replace all factories which did create DynamicProperty

	* rulesets/EntityProperties.cpp: Remove a huge bunch of property
	  template specialisations that aren't used. Fix the ones left.

	* common/Database.cpp: Add an error check when escaping strings for

	* rulesets/Character.cpp: Update all code which sent an update
	  operation so that it sets the flags rather than naming them
	  in the argument.

	  Re-write isOpen() to use the is_open method of the overlying
	  socket object, rather than always returning true. This issue may

	  variable defining stamina level below which combat cannot occur.

	* rulesets/Combat.cpp: Switch to stamina as the base stat for

	  client write timeouts, and a possible way to handle traffic
	  shaping in future.

2002-08-13  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* server/CommClient.h: Don't disconnect connections when writing
	  times out.

2002-08-11  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* Added pkgconfig and sigc++ autotools macros into acinclude.m4
	  as only one or the other should be required, not both.

	* server/Connection.h, server/Connection.cpp: Move large methods
	  into .cpp file to avoid bloat. Add in non ref method
	  for removing deleted objects, as references are a problem.

	* Account.h, Account.cpp: characterDestroyed method now
	  takes value rather than reference because of sigc++. Add
	  necessary headers.

	  using SigC signals.

	* rulesets/Entity.h, rulesets/Entity.cpp, rulesets/Py_World.cpp:
	  Remove pointless deleted flag, as the only time its true is when
	  the object has been deleted, and accessing would cause a segfault.

2002-07-27  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	  Use forward declarations rather than including Move.h.

	* server/Account.cpp, server/Account.h, server/Connection.cpp,
	  server/Connection.h: Use destroyed signal to ensure references
	  to in game entities are removed when those entities are

	  users logged in.

	* server/server.cpp: Fixed metaserver code so it only sends
	  termination packet if metaserver functionality is enabled.

	* server/Connection.h, server/Connection.cpp, server/CommServer.cpp,
	  server/CommClient.h, server/Account.cpp: Fix logouts so they
	  do cause the client connection to be closed.

	* Finished switch from Fire operation to Burn.

2002-07-25  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	  to WorldAccessor.

	* mason.xml, cyphesis.vconf: Stop using the Acorn ruleset in Mason,

	  that it more cleanly handles attributes.

	* common/BaseWorld.h: Re-write world.getObject() so that it
	  no longer uses std::map::operator[], as the old method was
	  inserting NULLs into the world dictionary when non-existant
	  entities were queried.

	* rulesets/Character.cpp: Clean up outstanding issues when movement
	  position is supplied, and is very close to being correct, and
	  clarify comments about movement when neither destination nor
	  source are provided.

	* rulesets/Character.cpp: Modify mind2body interface so that setting

	  layer so that rather than copying ops that are to be sent to
	  the mind, the w2m functions returning a flag indicating whether

	  final, as they are never overridden.

	* rulesets/Creator.cpp: Correct comments.

	* rulesets/MemMap.cpp: Add comments clarifying behavoir, and remove
	  old pseudo-code.

	* server/Account.cpp, server/Account.h: Ensure that an accounts
	  character dictionary only ever contains characters. Other entities
	  that the account chooses to create will no be stored here. Add
	  function to be called at login time to make sure that characters
	  stored here are still around.

	* server/Connection.cpp, server/Connection.h, server/ExternalMind.cpp,
	  server/ExternalMind.h: When external mind of a character is
	  destroyed, ensure that the character is removed from the

	* rulesets/Character.cpp, rulesets/Character.h: Get rid of
	  inefficiency handling ops from internal and external mind. Fix
	  leak of some ops.

	* common/BaseWorld.h, server/WorldRouter.cpp, server/WorldRouter.h:
	  Add method for getting a new serialno.

	* rulesets/Thing.cpp, rulesets/Thing.h, server/WorldRouter.cpp:
	  Set refno on ops as they come back from entities. Set serialnos
	  on same ops at the same time, but do not set serialnos
	  on ops that come in from elsewhere, as those are now handled at
	  source.

	* rulesets/Creator.cpp, rulesets/Character.cpp:
	  Ensure that ops from external client preserve their serialno,

	* rulesets/Character.cpp, rulesets/Movement.cpp, rulesets/Movement.h:
	  Tweaked movement code to cut down on redundant ticks when movement
	  has reached destination. Fixed bug where character jumped if it
	  walked into a building.

	* rulesets/Pedestrian.cpp: Modified collision resolution so that
	  movement does not slow down if it is deflected.

2002-05-10  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	  get rid of operator bool, to ensure that no implicit conversion
	  happens where it shouldn't. Add operator required for debugging
	  Quaternion.

	* modules/Location.cpp: Use new isValid() method instead of
	  relying on operator bool.

	* rulesets/Movement.h, rulesets/Pedestrian.cpp, rulesets/Pedestrian.h:
	  Fix up interface for genFaceOperation() so it works the right
	  way round, and orientation is not actually set until the Move
	  op is genuinly dispatched.

	* rulesets/Character.cpp: Add clearer debugging output.
	  Fix up handling orientation in move ops from mind, and generate
	  the move ops for simple change in orientation correctly.

	  a more accurate term.

	* common/globals.cpp, common/globals.h, tools/cyloadrules.cpp:
	  Put admin modifiable config in etc instead of share directory.

	* Don't build cycmd if readline is not available. Untested, and

	  ServerRouting.

	* common/BaseWorld.h: Made accessor method const, as it should be.

	  modules/Location.cpp, client/CreatorClient.cpp:
	  Removed some obsolete comments.

	* server/WorldRouter.h, server/WorldRouter.cpp: Add member to
	  deliver operation to known entity. Make use if it to avoid
	  having to recurse in operation() when broadcasting. Ensure
	  that the container of new entities is managed from here.

	* rulesets/Thing.cpp: Tell world to create new entities at the
	  same position as the creator if no other info is provided.
	  Do not attempt to handle setting up the default containership

	* rulesets/Py_Location.cpp: Implement handling of the orientation
	  attribute from python.

	  to other accounts.

	* rulesets/Py_WorldTime.cpp: Added python is_now() method because
	  using comparison does not appear to work.

	* rulesets/BaseMind.cpp: Added updating of minds WorldTime each

	  the build. Used to track details of the time. Added support for
	  checking time descriptions such as "midday", "summer" against

	  object. Ensure that an object is deleted from ServerRouting's
	  idDict when it is deleted from the world.

	  rulesets/Character.cpp, rulesets/Entity.h, rulesets/Entity.cpp,
	  rulesets/Python_API.cpp: Added handling of operation types not
	  directly supported by C++ classes in the scripting engine. In
	  order for these to be used they must be created in a script, and
	  received in a script.

	* rulesets/Character.cpp: Avoid using RootOperation pointers unless
	  that is really what we mean.

	* rulesets/Character.cpp: Added code to delete operations from
	  internal mind when external mind is active.

	  back to using version included.

	* server/Connection.cpp: Check for account in database when
	  user tries to create new account.

	  C++ base class. This much improves the performance of modelling
	  animals, and means that player characters, and NPCs get hungry and
	  need to eat. Reduced the speed at which animals consume energy
	  so they don't starve quite as quickly.

	* Added collision prediction functions that handle both entities
	  having velocity.

	* modules/Location.h: Added inRange() method which can be used
	  to check whether location, including bounding box, is within
	  given range of a given location. Changed parent member
	  variable to ref to fit with Atlas spec. Changed all code
	  related to using the term ref instead of parent so
	  that there is no confusion between ref for coordinates
	  and parent in the Atlas hierarchy.

	* rulesets/Thing.cpp: Added code to move operation to check
	  what entities come into and out of range when entity moves.
	  Appearance and Disappearance operations are sent to the
	  moving entity with a list of the relevant entities as their
	  argument.

	* server/WorldRouter.h/cpp: Added overloaded Look operation
	  handler which applies range constraints to the contains
	  attribute before returning.

	  though it is not always easy to tell whether the acorn script
	  is working or not.

2001-02-05  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* watchdog/*: Fleshed out watchdog functionality, which is now working

2001-01-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed pig mind so it is now better able to detect "Sowee"

	* Removed map from Thing, and put it into basmind. Re-wrote
	  script_Operation for thing so it now looks things up in world

	* Fixed so that we are no longer sending broadcast look ops, which
	  clag the server up and are not correct behavoir.

	* Minor fixes/python tweaks.

	* Slight change to ordering of ops in the queue, so more recently
	  created ops with the same time stamp come of the queue after
	  older ops.

	* Implemented contains attribute so newly created objects are added

	* Implemented conversion of Python Operation and Oplist objects
	  to Message::Object.

	* Fixed MemMap so that attributes of Things are accuratly updated.

	* Fixed it so that look ops from mind are broadcast rather than sent
	  to world. This may have to be reverted.

	* Tweaked autoconf to make it cleaner and work better. Still needs
	  alot of work.

	  the operation they point to, and thus delete it in dealloc().

	* Implemented find_by_location() and find_by_type() as required in
	  MemMap, and corresponding python interface.

	* Put in temporary work around to deal with the fact that a mind
	  does not know its name. Currently the mind is not able to
	  discover any of its bodies attributes, and I am not sure how
	  to solve this.

	* Fixed Location and Vector3D so they use operator bool() to detect
	  whether they are set.

	* Fixed bugs in getting parent from Location in python which caused
	  segfaults.

	* Imported all the basic ruleset entity python scripts.

	  so that operation manipulations can now work.

	* Implemented getting of object name to python/C API, and added
	  methods for differentiating between op and object.

	* Implemented on-the-fly de-coding of operations, from operation
	  arguuments in python/C API. This will be obsolete once Atlas-C++
	  does full decode later.

	* Put debugging back in cos I still need it.

2000-11-26  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added in Python interface code to deal with manipulation of operation
	  time.

	* Made basic_tick a float, because it should be.

	* Imported all the rulesets python code from python cyphesis.

2000-11-26  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed and changes to code so that operations created in python
	  mind code are delivered as required.

2000-11-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Disabled some of the excessive debugging.

	* Implemented getting and setting of to and from in operations
	  using map to lookup what the mind knows about the entities
	  in question. This involved adding an extra field to the
	  RootOperationObject structure to store to and from entities.

	* Sorted out base_init() python member so __init__() of all
	  classes in inheritance tree are called.

	* Started work on set_kw() replacement.

	* Added python module finding mechanism which is required to deal
	  with rulesets correctly. I am not convinced this works.

2000-11-23  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added oplist python interface, and implemented returning of
	  operations from python code.

2000-11-22  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Moved character mode calculation into MovementInfo class.

	* Added new MovementInfo method which creates a movement op to
	  change the rotation of a character when no other update is needed.

2000-11-22  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Filled out Location python interface so it is now fully functional.

	* Inlined Vector3D class for performance.

2000-11-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Bug fix that meant that updates to MemMap object caused segfault.

2000-11-21  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Filled out the python common.const module with all its values.

	* Added code required to create an operation from with python.

	* Modified the Thing python interface so that python objects
	  that Atlas doesn't want to know about are stored in a normal
	  attributes list.

2000-11-20  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added some more python interface classes. There is now enough code
	  here to start importing real mind code from cyphesis-py.

2000-11-19  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Two small bug fixes. One stops a crash when the client tries
	  to move an object which does not exist, the other removes an
	  unnecessary pointer check which stopped the admin client from
	  working.

2000-11-19  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Filled in BaseMind functionality so it now keeps memory map up		  to date. Added necessary features to Python/C++ interface
	  for sight operations to be passed onto python code after processing
	  in C++. Added new type of op switch to deal with operations
	  in the argument of a sight/sound operation.

	* Added features to Opeation python interface for args to be
	  accessed as if operation is a sequence object.

	* Implemented python API for C++ memory map class.

	* Added utility function which uses code borrowed from Atlas-C++
	  to convert a Message::Object into something from the Objects
	  code.

2000-11-18  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Moved some of BaseMind functionality in a python class and
	  added the necessary interface code.

	* Initial port of MemMap class from python to C++, together with
	  python interface. Hopefully maintenance of MemMap can be kept
	  in C++ for speed if possible.

2000-11-16  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Sorted out error handling from python code, and no-longer treat
	  no method as an error.

	* Got python interface code to the point that python classes can now
	  access the C++ attributes of a Thing.

	* Split the python interface code into separate files depending
	  on the type of C++ class the code relates to.

2000-11-16  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added code for standard Get/Set methods for operations.
	  Eventually this functionality will be moved into getattr
	  and setattr methods.

	* Added code for a Thing object which wrappers a C++ Thing * pointer.

2000-11-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Cleaned up problems with mode in move operations, and dealt
	  with stopping when velocity is set to zero.

2000-11-15  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed silly typo in movement code which meant that velocity was
	  not being used to calculate direction when only velocity is
	  specified.

2000-11-14  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added more Python/C API code. Basic framework now exists for
	  creating and manipulating Operations in the python code.

2000-11-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed setting location of newly created objects

	* Fixed setting weight as float on default Thing.

	* Added more support for mode and face in movement code.

	* Cleaned up the debugging output code.

	* Fixed looking, and added support for contains attribute

2000-11-10  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added more refno capabilities

	* Fixed some operation instantiation bugs

	* Added full support for creator entity. Admin client can now populate
	  the world with items and NPCs.

2000-11-09  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Removed two conflicting "WorldRouter * world" members from
	  class hierarchy.

	* Added setting of refno to operations, so client can tell
	  what they apply to.

	* Sorted out initialisation of python path.

	* Added loading of admin account, allowing admin client to communicate.

	* Made sure all attributes of created objects are set, so that
	  character gender works.

	* Added face attribute to Thing, to indicate what direction it faces!

	* Modified error operation so it complies with traditional format

2000-11-08  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added enough python interface to load a simple module, get the
	  class from it, instantiate that class, and call operation methods
	  from it. Still to be implented is the Atlas-C++ API for embedded
	  python.

2000-11-07  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed movement code so that id of object to be moved is correctly
	  present. uclient now sees movement. Woohoo!

2000-11-07  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixed. uclient movement now works within the server,
	  but uclient does not like the responses it gets.

	* Fixed a bug which caused a segfault when movement stops.

2000-11-05  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixes, including lots of clearer debugging output.
	  Still does not seem to correctly handle moves which don't 
	  specify direction.

2000-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* More movement fixes. I now get almost expected behavoir

	* Switched over to new Atlas location spec now that this is supported
	  by uclient.

2000-11-04  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Improved debugging output in movement code, and fixed some critical
	  bugs which meant that movement was not working correctly.

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Modified legacy location code so it is now activated by a single
	  #define

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added temporary support for old Atlas style location object
	  in entity to move operations. This allows uclient to work for
	  now until it moves over to the latest Atlas spec.

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed some attributes of in-game object

	* Added temporary support for old style Atlas location so we still
	  work with uclient.

2000-11-02  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed it so that server does not exit if client negotiation fails.

	* Cleaned up detection of disconnected client

	* Re-wrote thing factory so it is now a static object instance rather
	  that a static method, and added the beginnings of support for
	  python "Thing" classes.

2000-10-31  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Modified stream code to get rid of seeking-on socket problem

2000-10-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added handling of client disconnection

2000-10-24  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed movement code which now works.

	* Fixed set operation, and added attributes map to Thing.

	* Started adding Python interface code.

	* Starting changelog from initial attempt to port cyphesis into C++.
