# This file contains global settings for the cyphesis server. Typically it is not
# necessary to modify this file when setting up a server. It is better to override
# settings in this file by adding them to .cyphesis.vconf in the home directory of
# of the user who runs the server. This makes it possible for more than one user
# to run a server on the same machine, by overriding the port number used, and the
# database name.
