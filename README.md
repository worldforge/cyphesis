Cyphesis is the server for the [WorldForge](http://worldforge.org/ "The main Worldforge site") system.

It provides a complete solution for running an MMORPG server. Amongst its features are

* Fully scriptable through Python
* Live reload of both rules and world entities; edit your world without having to shut down or reload
* Complete 3d physics simulation
* Complex AI system, using Behavioral Trees and Python scripts
* Out-of-process AI, allowing for distributed AI clients
* Persistence through either SQLite or PostgreSQL
* Powerful built in rules for visibility and containment of entities
* Emergent gameplay through multiple simple systems interacting
* Quick and powerful procedural terrain generation

## Installation

The simplest way to install all required dependencies is by using [Conan](https://www.conan.io).

```bash
conan remote add worldforge https://artifactory.ogenvik.org/artifactory/api/conan/conan
conan install . --build missing
cmake --preset conan-release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./build/install/release
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target all
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target mediarepo-checkout 
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target media-process-install 
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target install
```

NOTE: The invocation of the target "media-process-install" is optional. It will go through the raw Subversion assets and
convert .png to .dds as well as scaling down textures. If you omit this step Cyphesis will instead use the raw
Subversion media. Which you might want if you're developing locally.

### Tests

The test suite can be built and run using the ```check``` target. For example:

```
make check
```

### Documentation

Documentation describing how the system works can be found [here](docs/dox/index.md).

There's also a collection of design documents found in the ["docs/design" directory](docs/design)

### API documentation

If Doxygen is available API documentation can be generated using the ```dox``` target. For example:

```
make dox
```

### Python stubs

When editing the Python scripts that make up the rulesets it's a good idea to add the directory "docs/python" to
your IDE's Python include paths. This directory contains stubs generated from the C++ bindings, which makes things such
as type lookup and code completion easier.

These stubs are auto generated from the C++ bindings through the custom target "GeneratePythonDocs".
Execute this target whenever you've done edits to the Python bindings.

## Dependencies

We use Conan for our dependency handling. If you're developing locally you can issue this command to setup both a "
debug" and "release" environment.

```bash
conan install -s build_type=Debug . --build missing --update  && conan install . --build missing --update
```

## Running a basic server

Start the server with the ```cyphesis``` command. It will output some startup
messages and then run in the foreground. If you want to run the server in
the background, start the server with the option --cyphesis:daemon=true .

If an empty server is started, it will automatically be populated if the
[Worldforge Worlds](https://github.com/worldforge/worlds) definitions have
been installed.

If everything has worked so far, and you are not planning to do any
server or world development at this time then you do not need to read any
of the rest of these instructions.

## Usage and configuration

The main server binary is called cyphesis. Its command line arguments and
configuration are managed by "varconf", which means options can be set in
configuration files and on the command line. The main configuration file
is called cyphesis.vconf, and server settings are stored in the [cyphesis]
section. The file can be found in the cyphesis source directory, and is
installed into the sysconf directory, which is by default /etc. Settings
in this configuration file can be overridden in on the command line, and
once overridden they will be stored permanently in ~/.config/cyphesis.vconf.
In order to drop back to the default settings,
remove this file. Settings can be incrementally overridden in
cyphesis.vconf non-interactively by passing them as command line
options to cyconf. cyconf will store any settings it is given in
cyphesis.vconf and then exited. If you are planning to have multiple
servers run on the same system at the same or different times, the easiest
way to handle the differences in configuration would be to use the
cyphesis.vconf file, and avoid modifying the master configuration file.

As an example, the ruleset to be used is set in cyphesis.vconf as follows:

```
   [cyphesis]
   ruleset="deeds"
```

This setting can be overridden by invoking cyphesis with the following
option:

```
   --cyphesis:ruleset=werewolf
```

It's also possible to specify settings using environment variables. They must be prefixed by "WF_" and first specify the
section and then the key, separated by "_". For example, "WF_cyphesis_bindir=/foo/bar" would set the item "bindir" in
the "cyphesis" section to "/foo/bar".

For more details of varconf usage see the Varconf documentation. For full
details on configuraton options for cyphesis, see the cyphesis(1) man
page.

The ruleset specified indicates the entity types available, the set of
scripts that will be used for these entities, and the initialisation
script used to populate the server.

If an empty server is started, it will automatically be populated if the
[Worldforge Worlds](https://github.com/worldforge/worlds) definitions have
been installed.

The default ruleset for this version is called Deeds.

## User provided Python scripts

When both the "cyphesis" server and the "cyaiclient" AI process starts they look
for extra python scripts to run in the "~/.local/share/cyphesis/cyaiclient.d"
and "~/.local/share/cyphesis/cyphesis.d" directories respectively.

This allows a developer to for example set up Python remote debugging.
One example would be to use the remote Python debugger included in PyCharm
Professional. By creating a file named "10-debug.py" containing this code
a connection will be made at startup with the debugger on port 9999.

```python
import sys

sys.path.append('path_to_pycharm-debug-py3k.egg')
import pydevd

pydevd.settrace('localhost', port=9999, stdoutToServer=False, stderrToServer=False, suspend=False)
```

## Using standard malloc memory allocator in Python

During development it can sometimes be good to use the standard "malloc" memory allocator rather than
the Python specific allocator. For example if you want to profile memory usage.
This can be enabled by setting the environment variable "PYTHONMALLOC" to something (doesn't matter what).
Upon startup Cyphesis will then use malloc, and write a line about this to the log.

## Performance measuring through Remotery

Performance tracking through [Remotery](https://github.com/Celtoys/Remotery) is built in,
but not enabled by default. You need to set the option "--cyphesis:remotery=true" to enable it.

After that's done you can open the file found at [external/Remotery/vis/index.html]() to see
real time measurements.
