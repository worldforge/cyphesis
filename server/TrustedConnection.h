/// \brief This class represents a connection from a client that is inherently
/// trusted, and can thus login without a password
///
/// This allows us to allow clients to login automatically without needing to
/// store the admin password in plain text anywhere. The client might be
/// trusted because it has connected with a known certificate of some kind,
/// or because it has connected over a unix domain socket.
