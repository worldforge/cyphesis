/// reference to the entity, rather than risk pointing to the statistics
/// member for a deleted entity. As there is nothing in the structure
/// for this type that is specific to Statistics, the struct has been
/// names PyEntityWrapper, so it can be used to solve similar requirements
/// for other submodules of entity. The methods for a python object are
/// defined by its PyTypeObject, which is independant of the struct
