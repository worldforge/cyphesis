/// physics, collision detection etc. For example, when modelling character
/// movement, in addition to conventional gravity and collision detection
/// it is also necessary to model the fact that the character tracks the
/// surface of the terrain. This means that clients must adjust their
/// predicted position of characters to track the terrain, and must be
/// given the right cues to indicate that this is the right thing to do.
/// Similarly a boyant object needs to track the surface of the water,
/// including any procedural waves on the water.
