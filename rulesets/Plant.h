/// \brief This is the base class for flowering plants.
///
/// Most of the functionality will be common to all plants, and most
/// derived classes will probably be in python. Provides functionality
/// for producing and dropping fruit very simply.
///
/// The basic functionality of Plant is as follows:
/// 1) The plant receives a tick operation. It checks it's m_nourishment value to see
/// whether it should grow or wither.
/// If the plant has fruitName set, it will also do a check whether it should drop a fruit or not.
/// It also sends an Eat operation to it's parent.
/// 2) If the parent is the world, the world will respond to the Eat operation by checking
/// if the plant is in a favourable spot (i.e. a place where it can grow, like in the bare ground).
/// If so, the World will send a Nourishment op to the plant.
/// 3) The plant receives the Nourishment op and adds its value to m_nourishment.
///
/// \ingroup EntityClasses
